# Wellcome to Uranus

# Idea
This is my first time programming with arbitrum stylus. I feel it is interesting and full of development potential. My idea is to create an NFT auction platform.

# Usability
Users can put their NFTs up for auction. Each auction will last about 3 days, 5 days or 1 week. For now, auction participants can only bid with eth. After the auction period ends, users can withdraw the amount they auctioned. There is a desired price. If the user's price is higher than the desired price, then at the end of the auction they will receive the NFT

# Future
In the future I will integrate more auctions with other erc20s. It is also possible to develop it into an NFT marketplace. In addition, I want to integrate auction advertising for influencers. The influencer will share the link to warpcast.com and for each person participating in the auction they will receive a commission
